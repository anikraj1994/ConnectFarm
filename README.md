# ConnectFarm (InOut)	


The 'userapp/ConnectFarm' directory is the android studio project. This is the client side app which is used to buy the products sold by the farmer.

The 'Localreg' directory is again the android studio project which is to be used at Local Village offices or Anyone who has access to the internet near the farmer. This acts like a gateway to register the farmer to the service. This is a one time registration and after this internet is not required to sell the goods online.

The 'phpp/connectfarmphp' is the git repo of the heroku instance running. This facilitates the sms and the voice IVR calls to make all this possible. This connects all the client app to the farmer through sms.
